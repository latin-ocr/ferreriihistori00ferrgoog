vi PREFACE.

1n1540, he was again induced ιο come to Scotland by the earnest
entreaties oi his patron, who in that year was raised to the Bishopriek of
Orkney, but, still holding the Abbey oi Kinloss with the priory oiBeau·
lieu io commendato, he again placed Ferrarius at Kinloss, who renewed his
instructions to the monks ci that Abbey, along with some monks ci
Beaulieu, placed there to have the benefit oi his tuition.

Four years later, we lind him again preparing to quit Soctlaud, terrilied
or disgusted by the violence oi reformation which theu rendered Scotland
no pleasant residence ior the inmate of a cloister. He was still alive
at the date oi the rental annexed ιο this volume, since we find there
charged against the Abbey, his peusion of 240, which, he informs us, was
settled upon him by his patron Abbct Rcbert Reid, cn his second coming
to Scotloud. He probably spent the latter years of his life at Paris,
where his edition oi Boecc's Histcry, with a wretched supplement by
himself, was published in 1574.

of the life and character of cnr author, we know scarcely anything.
That he was diligent in the discharge ol his duty is proved not more by
the long muster-roll of the works which he read and expounded to his
pupils than by the continued trust reposed in him by a person so accom-
plished and so zealous in the cause cl learning as Robert Reid, Bishop

= cf Orkney.

iiis learning and scholarship, oi which he himself was plainly well

satisfied, were, no doubt, considerable, os compared with the average
' acquirements oi the monks of Kinloss3 but the works he has left do

not impress us with so high an opinion of his abilities or judgment, as of
his industry and hir love of writing. Ιι will bc observed that he made his
prelections not from the original language of the works ol Aristotle and
the other Greek authors whom he expounded, but was content to use a

Latin version.
