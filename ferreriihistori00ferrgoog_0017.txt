PREFAGE. vii

In the diligent discharge of his duty as a toacher, with the occasionnl
distraction of composing some little treutise to raise his reputation in the
world or gain favour with a patron, our anthor’s life at Kinloss must have
passed away peacefully and pleasantly, notwithstanding the little disputo
which he dignifies somewhat too much in recording it.(¹) His posthumous
fortune has not been so enviable, since he has drcwn down upon him the
indignation of Lord Hailes by two 'unluoky blunders which chanced to
orosa his Lordship in his most earnost investigatione. The first was the
repetitionlll of the foolish legend of St. David sending his messengers
to collect the laws of foreign states, and from these compiling the Ιίῳίαηι
Mcty‘estotem. The other, if possible a more heinous offence in Lord
Hailes’s estimation‚ consisted in rashly asserting thot Adam Gordon
was amad Earl of Sutherland, instead of hemming Earl in right of his
wife, Elisabeth, the Oonntess. For both of these transgressione he is
subjeoted to severe olrastisement 3<⁸l and the latter brings under Lord
Hailes’s censure the present work :-“ Had they looked,” says his Lord·
ship, “ into his account of the Abbots of Kinloss, they would have per-
eeived how menn his abilities were, ond how contemptible his station.”(⁴)

It is indeed difficult to imogine any thing more imperfect and inaccu-
rate than the early part of tho following work; but if the fable of the
Iispshna and the mistake about the Earldom of Sutherland, hod not roused

Lord Hailes to more than usual indignation, he would not hove censured
so severely a work which the author had not linished and of the unovoid·
able imperfectione of which he speaks in atone to deprecate criticism.t⁵)
Our author’s materiale wore evidently very defective, and seem to have
consisted of little more than the martyrologium, or obitnary‚ recording the
