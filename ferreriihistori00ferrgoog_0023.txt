PREnAcn. xiii

Some light has already been thrown upon the early endowments of the
Abbeyof Kinloss hya few charters printed with the Chartulary of Morey.
Α chartor of Strathyla, by Williom the hicn, is nlso annexed ιο the present
volume. It has been printed from an old copy preserved in the Record
of Deedsl¹l in the Generul Register House, collatsd with o copy in Show's
'History of Marsy, which seems ιο hare been printed from the original
Clrarter.

une Rental of the Abbey, which is guen in the Appendix, is taken
from the Register of the Assumption of &helices—n valuation made in
1562 nnd the following years, for regnlnting the third of the greater bene·
lices to bc paid to the reformed Clergy and ιο the Crown. This particular
account would seem from a date which immediately follows it, ιο hare
been rendered in 1574, but may hare been earher. It would appear not
to have been in nll respectu satisfactory. After a short voluationl of the

Priory of Beaulieu, then held io commendam with Kinloss, the Register
has the following note :-“ Remembor my Lord Gomptrollare to speir the

renlall of thir tua, Kynlor and Bewlie, hettir, for thay ar suspitious anent

the fischingis.”

Hector hoece, who, Ferrcrius sellense) attended Abhot Thomas Chry-
stnll during his last illness, describes Kinloss in his time in terme which
savour of his usunl exaggeration,-“ Nunc ibi cenobium cst cum angustissimo
templo dicre odgini sacro, addeque magnifice structum piorum coetc Cia-
tercionrir instituti fruique, nulli io Altinae religionis oboo‘mtionc remensum?
Unfortuuately we have no more particular account of the Abbey buildings
than what is ufforded by Ferrarius. On the margin of one of the peges
of the Edinburgh Ms. is this note:

nhc sopri! errorores ιιεῑοιιοορε . . .. 1574.
