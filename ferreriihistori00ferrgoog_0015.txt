---.----..

So few Records of the Monostic Institutione of Sootland hara coma down
to us, that we receive with some interest even such a meagre and imper-
fect outline as Ferrarius has left us of the history of tha Abhey of Kinloss.

J oannes Ferrarius, was, as ha tells us himself, a native of the little town
of Rive, iu the territory of Chieri, in Piedmont. Educated at 'lirrin and

Paris in tha literature and philosophy of the day, he appears, while at
the latter University‚ to have attracted the notice of Robert Reid, who κ
had shortly before been appointed successor of Thomas Ohrystall in the
Abbacy of Kinloss. The new Abbot elect, with other leading ohurchmen
of Scotland at that time, had projected¹ the reformation of the monastic

houses, and the introduction ola more scholastic education than was then
attuinabla in this country. Ferrarius was recommanded to his notice, as
a person qualified to assist in these objecta, by Robert Richardson, himself
employed on a similar mission by the Abbot of Cambuslrenneth3 and hc
accompanied his patron to Scotland in 1528. After spending some time
at Oourt, hc was established bytho Abbot, at his monastery of Kinloss, as
ateacher of the monks, and continued there, as he says, devoted to that
duty, and to private study, from 1531 till 1537, when we lind him re·
solving on a visit to his nativa country, which he carried into effect.
